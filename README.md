# Automatic Onboarding Backend for HR
Overview
This backend system automates the onboarding process for HR departments, streamlining new employee integration and reducing manual workload. HR staff can log into the app, add new employees by filling in their name and email. The new employee then receives an email with a link to a form for uploading required documents in image and PDF formats. The system uses the OpenAI API to analyze the uploaded documents and fill out the onboarding form based on the data extracted. Once the employee submits the form, the data is saved in the database.
